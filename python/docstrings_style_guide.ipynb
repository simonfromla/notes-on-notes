    "* Use 4-space indentation, and no tabs.\n",
    "    4 spaces are a good compromise between small indentation (allows greater nesting depth) and large indentation (easier to read). Tabs introduce confusion, and are best left out.\n",
    "* Wrap lines so that they donâ€™t exceed 79 characters.\n",
    "    This helps users with small displays and makes it possible to have several code files side-by-side on larger displays.\n",
    "* Use blank lines to separate functions and classes, and larger blocks of code inside functions.\n",
    "* When possible, put comments on a line of their own.\n",
    "* Use docstrings.\n",
    "* Use spaces around operators and after commas\n",
    "* Name your classes and functions consistently;\n",
    "    the convention is to use CamelCase for classes and lower_case_with_underscores for functions and methods\n",
