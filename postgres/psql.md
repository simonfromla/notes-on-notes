### SELECT  

One of the most common tasks is to query the DB by using the SELECT statement. 
It can also become complex due to its ability to combine a number of clauses to perform a query.  
The clauses that appear with the SELECT statement are:  

* Select distinct rows by using the __DISTINCT__ operator  
* Filter rows by using the __WHERE__ clause  
* Select rows by using the __ORDER BY__ clause  
* Select rows based on various operators such as __BETWEEN__, __IN__ and __LIKE__  
* Group rows into groups using the __GROUP BY__ clause  
* __HAVING__ to apply conditions to the groups  
* Join tables together using __INNER JOIN__, __LEFT JOIN__, __FULL OUTER JOIN__, and __CROSS JOIN__
